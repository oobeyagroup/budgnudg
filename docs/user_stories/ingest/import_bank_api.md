# Import from Bank API

**Status**: 🔄 PLANNED  
**Epic**: Data Ingestion  
**Priority**: Should Have  
**Estimated Effort**: 13 points  
**Target Release**: Q1 2026  

## User Story

As a **busy professional**, I want to **automatically import my transactions directly from my bank through secure API connections** so that **I can keep my budget data current without manual CSV downloads and uploads**.

## Business Context

Manual CSV import requires users to:
- Log into multiple bank websites monthly
- Download and manage CSV files
- Remember to import regularly for accurate budgeting
- Deal with different bank export formats

API integration would provide:
- Real-time or scheduled automatic imports
- Reduced manual effort and improved data freshness
- Better user engagement through up-to-date information
- Competitive advantage over manual-only solutions

## Acceptance Criteria

### Bank Connection Management
- [ ] 🚧 Given I want to connect my bank account, when I access the connection interface, then I can securely authenticate with my bank through OAuth or similar secure method
- [ ] 🚧 Given I have connected accounts, when I view my account list, then I see connection status, last sync time, and available actions
- [ ] 🚧 Given I want to disconnect an account, when I remove the connection, then all associated credentials are securely removed
- [ ] 🚧 Given my bank connection expires, when I try to sync, then I receive clear instructions to re-authenticate

### Transaction Synchronization  
- [ ] 🚧 Given connected bank accounts, when I trigger a sync, then new transactions since last sync are imported automatically
- [ ] 🚧 Given duplicate detection, when syncing, then existing transactions are not re-imported
- [ ] 🚧 Given transaction data from API, when imported, then it matches the same format as CSV imports (category mapping, payoree assignment)
- [ ] 🚧 Given sync errors, when they occur, then I receive detailed error messages and retry options

### Automated Scheduling
- [ ] 🚧 Given I want automated imports, when I configure sync settings, then I can set daily/weekly/monthly automatic sync schedules  
- [ ] 🚧 Given scheduled syncs run, when new data is available, then I receive optional notifications about new transactions
- [ ] 🚧 Given sync failures occur, when automatic sync fails, then I receive alerts with troubleshooting guidance
- [ ] 🚧 Given I want to pause automation, when I disable scheduled sync, then manual sync remains available

## Technical Implementation Requirements

### Banking Integration Service
```python
# Proposed architecture
class BankConnection(models.Model):
    user = ForeignKey(User)
    bank_name = CharField()
    account_mask = CharField()  # Last 4 digits only
    connection_status = CharField(choices=['active', 'expired', 'error'])
    last_sync_at = DateTimeField()
    access_token_hash = CharField()  # Encrypted storage
    
class BankSyncLog(models.Model):
    connection = ForeignKey(BankConnection)
    sync_started_at = DateTimeField()
    sync_completed_at = DateTimeField(null=True)
    transactions_imported = IntegerField()
    status = CharField()
    error_message = TextField(blank=True)
```

### Integration Options Analysis

| Provider | Pros | Cons | Cost | Timeline |
|----------|------|------|------|----------|
| **Plaid** | Industry standard, 11,000+ banks, excellent docs | $0.60/user/month, dependency risk | Medium | 6-8 weeks |
| **Yodlee** | Enterprise-grade, comprehensive coverage | Higher cost, complex integration | High | 10-12 weeks |  
| **Finicity** | Good API, owned by Mastercard | Limited free tier | Medium | 8-10 weeks |
| **Open Banking APIs** | Direct bank integration, lower costs | Limited to specific banks, complex auth | Low | 12-16 weeks |

**Recommendation**: Start with Plaid for MVP due to developer experience and coverage.

### Security Requirements
- [ ] 🔐 All bank credentials encrypted at rest using AES-256
- [ ] 🔐 API tokens stored with TTL and automatic refresh
- [ ] 🔐 Bank communication over TLS 1.3 only
- [ ] 🔐 User consent management with granular permissions
- [ ] 🔐 Audit logging for all bank API interactions
- [ ] 🔐 Compliance with PCI DSS and SOC 2 requirements
