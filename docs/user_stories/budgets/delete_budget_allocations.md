# Delete Budget Allocations

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Epic**: Budget Management  
**Priority**: Should Have  
**Estimated Effort**: 5 points  
**ATDD Status**: ✅ Complete with 28 tests passing  

## User Story

As a **budget-conscious user**, I want to **delete unwanted or outdated budget allocations** so that **I can keep my budget plan clean, accurate, and reflect my current spending priorities**.

## Business Context

Users need to be able to remove budget allocations when:
- A payoree is no longer relevant (e.g., moved to new grocery store, canceled subscription)
- Budget categories change due to lifestyle adjustments
- Duplicate or erroneous allocations were created
- Simplifying budget structure by consolidating allocations
- Seasonal adjustments (removing summer-only expenses in winter)

Safe deletion is critical to maintain budget integrity and historical accuracy.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Safe Deletion Workflow

#### `allocation_deletion_access`
**Given** I have existing budget allocations  
**When** I view a budget allocation in the list or detail view  
**Then** I see a delete option that is clearly marked and accessible  
**And** the system shows appropriate warnings for destructive actions  

#### `allocation_deletion_confirmation`
**Given** I want to delete a budget allocation  
**When** I click the delete action  
**Then** the system presents a confirmation dialog with allocation details  
**And** I must explicitly confirm the deletion before it proceeds  

#### `allocation_deletion_validation`
**Given** I confirm deletion of an allocation  
**When** the system processes the deletion request  
**Then** the system validates that deletion is safe and permitted  
**And** prevents deletion if it would compromise data integrity  

#### `allocation_deletion_execution`
**Given** deletion validation passes  
**When** the allocation is deleted  
**Then** the allocation is removed from the database immediately  
**And** related budget calculations are updated automatically  

### Impact Assessment and Safety

#### `deletion_impact_analysis`
**Given** I want to delete an allocation with transaction history  
**When** I initiate deletion  
**Then** the system shows me the impact (number of transactions, spending amounts)  
**And** provides options for handling associated transaction data  

#### `historical_data_preservation`
**Given** an allocation has associated transaction history  
**When** I delete the allocation  
**Then** historical transactions remain intact and unmodified  
**And** the system maintains referential integrity for reporting  

#### `budget_recalculation`
**Given** I delete an allocation from an active budget plan  
**When** the deletion is completed  
**Then** budget totals and summaries are recalculated immediately  
**And** budget reports reflect the updated allocation structure  

### User Experience and Feedback

#### `deletion_success_feedback`
**Given** I successfully delete a budget allocation  
**When** the deletion completes  
**Then** I receive clear confirmation that the action was successful  
**And** I am redirected to an appropriate view (list or updated budget summary)  

#### `deletion_error_handling`
**Given** deletion fails due to system constraints or errors  
**When** the error occurs  
**Then** I receive a clear explanation of why deletion failed  
**And** suggested actions for resolving the issue  

#### `bulk_deletion_support`
**Given** I need to delete multiple allocations  
**When** I select multiple items in the allocation list  
**Then** I can delete them in a single batch operation  
**And** the system confirms the bulk deletion with appropriate warnings  

## MoSCoW Prioritization

### Must Have
- Single allocation deletion with confirmation
- Safe deletion validation (prevent orphaned references)
- Historical transaction preservation
- Budget recalculation after deletion
- Clear success/error feedback

### Should Have
- Impact analysis before deletion (show affected transactions)
- Bulk deletion for multiple allocations
- Undo functionality for recently deleted allocations
- Audit trail of deletion actions
- Smart suggestions when deleting (merge with similar allocation)

### Could Have
- Soft delete with recovery period (trash/recycle bin)
- Deletion scheduling (remove allocation after certain date)
- Advanced filters for bulk deletion (by date, amount, category)
- Export allocation data before deletion
- Deletion approval workflow for shared budgets

### Won't Have (Current Version)
- ❌ Cascade deletion of related transactions
- ❌ Permanent historical data removal
- ❌ Deletion of system-generated baseline allocations
- ❌ Bulk deletion without confirmation

## Technical Implementation Notes

**Views**: `BudgetAllocationDeleteView`, `BudgetAllocationBulkDeleteView`  
**Templates**: Deletion confirmation modals, impact analysis display  
**Services**: `AllocationDeletionService` for validation and cleanup  
**APIs**: RESTful deletion endpoints with proper HTTP methods  
**Security**: CSRF protection, user permission validation  

## Architecture Decisions

### Deletion Strategy
```python
class AllocationDeletionService:
    def validate_deletion(self, allocation, user):
        """Validate if allocation can be safely deleted"""
        # Check user permissions
        # Verify no critical dependencies
        # Assess impact on budget integrity
        
    def delete_allocation(self, allocation, preserve_history=True):
        """Execute safe deletion with optional history preservation"""
        # Update budget plan totals
        # Maintain transaction references
        # Log deletion for audit trail
        
    def assess_impact(self, allocation):
        """Analyze impact of deleting allocation"""
        # Count affected transactions
        # Calculate spending amounts
        # Identify dependent calculations
```

### Safety Constraints
- Prevent deletion if allocation is referenced by active recurring series
- Maintain transaction history even after allocation deletion
- Require explicit confirmation for allocations with significant spending
- Audit all deletion actions with user and timestamp
- Soft delete option for recovery within grace period

## User Interface Design

### Deletion Confirmation Dialog
```
⚠️  Delete Budget Allocation

You are about to delete:
• Whole Foods - $500.00/month
• October 2025 Budget Plan

Impact Analysis:
• 15 transactions will lose direct allocation reference
• $1,247.83 in spending history will be preserved
• Budget total will decrease from $2,850 to $2,350

☐ I understand this action cannot be undone
☐ Preserve transaction history (recommended)

[Cancel] [Delete Allocation]
```

## Testing Strategy

## Success Metrics

- Users can delete allocations in under 30 seconds
- 95%+ of deletions complete without errors
- Zero accidental data loss incidents
- Transaction history maintains 100% integrity after deletions
- Budget recalculations complete within 2 seconds

## Error Scenarios

### Permission Errors
- User doesn't own the allocation
- Budget plan is read-only or archived
- Insufficient user privileges

### Data Integrity Errors  
- Allocation is referenced by active recurring series
- Budget plan has dependent calculations
- System-generated allocation cannot be deleted

### System Errors
- Database connection issues during deletion
- Concurrent modification conflicts
- Transaction rollback failures

## Future Enhancement Ideas

1. **Smart Merging**: When deleting, suggest merging with similar existing allocations
2. **Deletion Analytics**: Track which types of allocations are deleted most often
3. **Recovery Workflow**: 30-day recovery period for accidentally deleted allocations
4. **Approval Process**: Require manager approval for large allocation deletions
5. **Batch Operations**: Advanced bulk deletion with filtering and conditions

## Dependencies

**Depends On**: 
- ✅ Create Budget Allocations (must exist before deletion)
- ✅ Budget Report Views (need to handle deleted allocations)
- ✅ Transaction Management (preserve references after deletion)

**Enables**:
- Budget plan maintenance and cleanup
- Seasonal budget adjustments
- Error correction workflows
- Budget simplification and optimization

## Security Considerations

- **Authorization**: Only allocation owners can delete their allocations
- **CSRF Protection**: All deletion requests must include CSRF tokens
- **Audit Logging**: Record all deletion actions with user, timestamp, and reason
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent rapid-fire deletion abuse
- **Backup Strategy**: Ensure deleted allocations can be recovered if needed

## Related User Stories

- **Create Budget Allocations** - Primary workflow this supports
- **Edit Budget Allocations** - Alternative to deletion for modifications
- **Budget Reporting** - Must handle deleted allocation references gracefully
- **Transaction Import** - Should not create allocations that were previously deleted
