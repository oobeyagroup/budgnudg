# Budget Report Classification Round Trip Navigation

**Status**: üöß IN PROGRESS  
**Epic**: Budget Management  
**Priority**: Must Have  
**ATDD Status**: In Progress  

## Related User Stories

The implementation of this feature should consider future integration with these related user stories, with design decisions favoring anticipated refactorings in these directions:

### Budget Management Dependencies
- [`docs/user_stories/budgets/budget_by_classification_atdd.md`](../budgets/budget_by_classification_atdd.md) - Budget by Classification Analysis (‚úÖ COMPLETED)
- [`docs/user_stories/budgets/create_multiple_budget_plans.md`](../budgets/create_multiple_budget_plans.md) - Multiple budget scenarios  

### Integration Points
- **Budget Report View**: Current high-level overview of all budget allocations grouped by category
- **Classification Analysis**: Detailed analysis with historical data and inline editing for specific classifications
- **Shared Navigation**: Consistent user experience across budget management interfaces

## User Story

As a **budget manager**, I want to **seamlessly navigate between the budget report overview and detailed classification analysis** so that **I can quickly drill down to adjust specific allocations and then return to see the overall budget impact**.

## Business Context

**Problem**: Users currently experience friction when managing budgets because they need to manually navigate between the high-level Budget Report (showing all categories) and the detailed Budget by Classification Analysis (for specific category adjustments). This creates context switching overhead and makes it difficult to see the immediate impact of detailed changes on the overall budget.

**Solution**: Implement bidirectional navigation with contextual links that preserve state and provide intuitive drill-down/roll-up workflows between the two budget views.

**Value**: Reduces time spent navigating, improves budget management efficiency, and enables faster budget adjustment cycles with better visibility into overall impact.


## Acceptance Criteria

### Navigation from Budget Report to Classification Analysis
- [ ] üöß `budget_report_category_drill_down` Given I'm viewing the Budget Report, when I click on a category row, then I'm taken to the Budget by Classification Analysis for that category
- [ ] üöß `budget_report_subcategory_drill_down` Given I'm viewing the Budget Report, when I click on a subcategory row, then I'm taken to the Budget by Classification Analysis for that subcategory  
- [ ] üöß `budget_report_payoree_drill_down` Given I'm viewing the Budget Report with payoree-level allocations, when I click on a payoree allocation, then I'm taken to the Budget by Classification Analysis for that payoree
- [ ] üöß `drill_down_context_preservation` Given I drill down from Budget Report to Classification Analysis, when the Classification Analysis page loads, then it displays the correct classification type and selection that matches what I clicked

### Navigation from Classification Analysis back to Budget Report
- [ ] üöß `classification_return_to_report` Given I'm viewing Budget by Classification Analysis, when I click a "Back to Budget Report" link, then I return to the Budget Report 
- [ ] üöß `classification_return_with_highlighting` Given I return from Classification Analysis to Budget Report, when the Budget Report loads, then the category/subcategory I was analyzing is visually highlighted or scrolled into view
- [ ] üöß `classification_changes_reflected` Given I made changes in Classification Analysis and return to Budget Report, when the Budget Report loads, then it shows my updated budget values

### Contextual Navigation Enhancement  
- [ ] üöß `breadcrumb_navigation` Given I'm in either Budget Report or Classification Analysis, when I view the page, then I see breadcrumb navigation showing my current location and available navigation paths
- [ ] üöß `quick_classification_switcher` Given I'm in Budget by Classification Analysis, when I want to switch to a different classification, then I can use a dropdown or quick-switcher without returning to Budget Report first
- [ ] üöß `budget_report_summary_widget` Given I'm in Budget by Classification Analysis, when viewing the page, then I see a summary widget showing key budget totals that would appear in Budget Report

### State Management and Performance
- [ ] üöß `navigation_state_preservation` Given I navigate between views, when I use browser back/forward, then each view maintains its previous state (filters, expanded sections, etc.)
- [ ] üöß `fast_navigation_performance` Given I navigate between Budget Report and Classification Analysis, when the page loads, then it loads within 2 seconds with proper loading indicators

## Technical Notes

### URL Structure Changes
```python
# Enhanced Classification Analysis URLs
/budgets/classification/?type=category&category_id=123&return=budget_report
/budgets/classification/?type=subcategory&subcategory_id=456&return=budget_report&highlight=category_123

# Budget Report with highlighting
/budgets/report/?highlight=category_123&section=expenses
```

### Template Modifications Required
- `budgets/budget_report.html`: Add drill-down links with proper URL generation
- `budgets/classification_analysis.html`: Add return navigation and breadcrumbs
- `base.html` or `budgets/base_budget.html`: Shared breadcrumb component
