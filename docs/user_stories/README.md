## ATDD Format Guidelines

When converting stories to Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD):

1. **Unique Test IDs**: Each acceptance criterion should have a unique identifier (e.g., `search_by_date_range`)
2. **Gherkin Format**: Use "Given [context], when [action], then [outcome]" format
3. **Test Linkage**: Link criteria to actual automated tests in the codebase
4. **Incremental Development**: Convert stories to ATDD format incrementally as they're implemented

## Example Stories

For reference examples of complete user stories, see:
- **[Advanced Transaction Search & Filtering](transactions/advanced_search_filtering.md)** - Example of comprehensive feature story
- **[Advanced Search ATDD](transactions/advanced_search_filtering_atdd.md)** - Example of ATDD format conversion
- **[Create Budget Allocations](budgets/create_budget_allocations.md)** - Example of core functionality story
- **[Review Budget Alignment](transactions/review_budget_alignment.md)** - Example with related stories section

## Writing Guidelines

### User Story Format
- Use active voice and specific user types
- Focus on user value and outcomes, not technical implementation
- Keep stories independent and testable

### Acceptance Criteria
- Write from the user's perspective
- Be specific and measurable
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Consider edge cases and error conditions

### Business Context
- Explain the "why" behind the feature
- Connect to business goals and user needs
- Provide context for future maintainers

### Related Stories
- Only include when there are genuine integration considerations
- Focus on design decisions that should anticipate future refactoring
- Organize by logical groupings (dependencies, synergies, infrastructure)
