ATDD Tests for Budget Allocation Deletion Workflow

These tests implement the acceptance criteria from:
docs/user_stories/budgets/delete_budget_allocations.md

Test Coverage:
- Safe deletion workflow with confirmation and validation
- Impact analysis and historical data preservation
- Budget recalculation and integrity maintenance
- User experience feedback and error handling
- Bulk deletion and advanced operations
